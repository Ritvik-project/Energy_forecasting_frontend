# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and what problem it solves.

## Problem Statement
Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are highly unpredictable due to their dependence on weather conditions. This unpredictability can cause fluctuations in energy generation, making it challenging to balance power supply and demand. Effective forecasting is crucial for energy grid stability and reducing reliance on fossil fuel-based backup power. 

This project aims to develop an AI-powered forecasting system that uses historical weather data to predict solar and wind energy generation, providing real-time insights for stakeholders in the energy sector.


## Background:
Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are highly unpredictable due to their dependence on environmental factors like weather conditions. This variability leads to fluctuations in energy generation, creating challenges for balancing supply and demand on the energy grid. These challenges make grid stability more difficult to maintain and increase reliance on fossil fuel-based backup power.

As renewable energy adoption grows, improving energy forecasting becomes crucial to managing grid stability. Effective forecasting can minimize the need for fossil fuel back-ups, optimize renewable energy utilization, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future.
